AWS was part of the [**Mobile World Congress (MWC)**](https://pages.awscloud.com/AWS-at-MWC-2023.html) event on February 27th - March 3rd, 2023 in Barcelona, Spain. MWC is the largest and most influential mobile technology and connectivity ecosystem event in the world, hosted by **Groupe Speciale Mobile Association (GSMA)** in Barcelona, Spain.

I was part of the [**Integrated Private Wireless (IPW) on AWS**](https://aws.amazon.com/telecom/integrated-private-wireless/) launch at MWC 2023, and had a blast meeting with colleagues, partners, and customers from across the globe. Here are some fun pictures:
