Found this website to check US Permanent Residency (Green Card) Process: [https://immigrationroad.com/green-card-tracker.php](https://immigrationroad.com/green-card-tracker.php) Just need to enter your **[Priority Date](https://www.murthy.com/2012/05/23/priority-dates-how-do-they-work/) and Chargeability.**

Here are sample results:

Now let's compare with EB3 with the same Priority Date & Chargeability. It has backlog for **6 years!!**

Feel very grateful that  I got [EB2](https://sigitp.wordpress.com/2012/10/01/permanent-residency-process/). Big thanks to my boss and my HR manager :)

UPDATE: my PERM approved two weeks ago yeah!!!!
