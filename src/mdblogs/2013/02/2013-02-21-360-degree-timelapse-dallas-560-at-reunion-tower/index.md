Took 1 hour to complete 360 degrees rotation. Visit https://www.reuniontower.com/ for exterior view.

The kitchen and cashier located in the middle part of the restaurant which is steady, but the dining tables rotate very slowly so we can enjoy Dallas city view. It even looks better at night but my iPhone was dead after 1 laps. The foods also great! But expensive :p

**Recorder:** iPhone 5 with iLapse apps.

**Venue:** Five Sixty by Wolfgang Puck Restaurant at Reunion Tower Dallas https://www.wolfgangpuck.com/restaurants/fine-dining/3917/
