Time flies when you're having fun, hence the obligatory Yellow Badge post: I finally got the coveted Yellow Badge to celebrate my 5th year amaversary at #AWS. My 5 years in numbers: 3 job families, 2 locations, 2 promotions, 5 blogs, 3 white-papers, 8 open source blogs, 8 inventor puzzles, many challenging projects, and 1931 Day-1s.

The list of friends, peers, managers, leaders, and mentors that I am thankful for is far too long to call out individually, but you know who you are!

Here’s to many more Day-1 adventures. Work hard, have fun, and make history!
