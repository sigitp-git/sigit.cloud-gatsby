**.::Fountain::.**

night got scare the dark, to the bottom of the empty words always bleeding my brain unsign papers, lies on the apartment floor like to tell that tomorow will never happen

ooo..dreams lead another dreams see the shining stone are waiting for the rims to renew the day of my black yesterday re-pictures my white canvas black, grey then white

the fountains of the tears, letting colors getting bright the sky turned on a thousand light my old windows, opened up and let me fell win is blowing, freedom is coming

ooo..dreams lead another dreams see the shining stone are waiting for the rims to renew the day of my black yesterday re-pictures my white canvas

ooo..dreams lead another dreams see the shining stone are waiting for the rims to renew the day of my black yesterday re-pictures my white canvas black, grey then white
