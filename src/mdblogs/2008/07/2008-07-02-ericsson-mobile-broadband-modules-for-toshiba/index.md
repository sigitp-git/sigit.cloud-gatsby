**Press Release: Ericsson to provide mobile broadband modules for Toshiba business laptops**

**Ericsson (NASDAQ: ERIC) has become partner of choice for the integration of HSPA mobile broadband modules into Toshiba’s business laptop range in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA). HSPA (High Speed Packet Access) is the world’s most widely deployed mobile broadband technology, with 198 commercially deployed networks available in 86 countries worldwide**

As the use of wireless LAN (WLAN) technology becomes increasingly widespread, the demand for real mobile broadband access to the Internet and company networks anytime/anywhere has significantly increased. Market analysts predict that laptops will remain the key mobile productivity tool for business and that HSPA technology will play a key role in this.

Through the partnership announced today, Toshiba and Ericsson will bring together extensive expertise in their respective fields. Thomas Teckentrup, General Manager Toshiba Computer Systems Division Europe, comments “Toshiba and Ericsson complement each other very well. While Toshiba has a strong position in the business laptop market, Ericsson has a lot of experience in the mobile broadband business. Through this partnership, we will create products that are greatly beneficial to our customers, assisting them in every aspect of their business lives.”

“With the integration of our Mobile Broadband Module into Toshiba’s business laptops we are supporting Toshiba’s vision of offering real mobile broadband connectivity to business users” Mats Norin, Vice President Mobile Broadband Modules, Ericsson, says.

Users of Toshiba business laptops will soon benefit from Ericsson’s latest wireless broadband technologies (HSPA) with modules allowing data rates of up to 7.2 Mbps in the downlink and up to 2.0 Mbps in the uplink. The module also has a GPS (Global Positioning System) receiver, to be used together with positioning applications. Toshiba plans to release first laptops equipped with Ericsson’s Mobile Broadband Modules in second half of 2008. The company has a long history of pioneering latest technologies: In 2006 Toshiba launched its first 3G embedded laptop.
