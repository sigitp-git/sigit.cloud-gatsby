I wrote this whitepaper with AWS team:

**Excerpt from the whitepaper**

"EThis whitepaper introduces the relevant use cases, solutions, and best practices for designing and deploying mobile private networks powered by AWS. Cloud-enabled mobile private networks allow enterprises, governments, and professional organizations to autonomously deploy their own geo-dispersed, secure mobile private networks. These networks cover private facilities while meeting their performance, reliability, availability, security, and scalability requirements."

The same reference architecture used for Carnegie Mellon University - Open Edge Computing Lab as follow:
