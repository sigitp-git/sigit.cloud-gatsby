I wrote this AWS Blog as part of Edge Computing initiatives and Private 5G use cases:

**Excerpt from the blog**

"Enterprises demand secure wireless networks that can be trusted with mission-critical tasks. As digital transformation and Internet of Things (IoT) become business imperatives, 4G and 5G private networks are a must to connect everything from robots, cameras, signage, and machinery to virtual reality applications.

At the same time, the demand for real-time stream processing is increasing rapidly with the explosion of streaming data from IoT sensors, the web, and other sources. Enterprises want to extract business value by processing this data while in motion using real-time analytics at the edge."
