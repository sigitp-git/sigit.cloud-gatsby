I was surprised because I didn't remember any of this before.[![Image](https://sigitp.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/x2_e58724f1.jpg?w=468)](https://sigitp.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/x2_e58724f1.jpg)

And then I remember, about 3 months ago, there was a SWA Magazine editor add me on LinkedIn and she was asking me to participate on Indonesian Diaspora survey. She sent me a form to fill in consisting personal information like: Name, Education History, Company & Work History, Salary, Compensation, Benefits and whether I will come back to Indonesia or not, etc.

I decided that since all the critical personal information will be kept anonymous, I could helped her and participate in the survey. I also forwarded the survey form to my Indonesian friends here in Ericsson Inc. US.

I didn't expect my picture to be posted on the magazine though, but I don't mind. Cool self publication on respected Indonesian business magazine :D. Thanks for letting me know Pyuth!

PS: the picture was taken by my beautiful wife @mayadewif in San Francisco (Golden Gate National Park), California, January 2012.
