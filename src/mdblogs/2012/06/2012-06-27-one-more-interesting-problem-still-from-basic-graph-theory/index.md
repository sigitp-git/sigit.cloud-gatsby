1. Suppose that you and your spouse/partner attended a party with three other couples. Several handshakes took place. None shook hands with him/herself or with his/her spouse/partner, and no one shook hands with the same person more than once. Sup- pose you ask each person, including your own date, how many hands he/she shook and found that each person gave a different answer.
    
    (a) How many hands did you shake?  
    (b) How many hands did your date shake?Â 
    
    Solutions will be posted next week also ;)
