Just doing my homework, this is the result:

[http://inet0.net/~sigit/tsp5cities/](http://inet0.net/~sigit/tsp5cities/ "http://inet0.net/~sigit/tsp5cities/")

The code inside is stupid...but since I code it only in 4 hrs, it should be fine for now, at least it works. Will continue to optimize the code if I have time.
