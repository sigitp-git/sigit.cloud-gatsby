Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go So make the best of this test, and don't ask why It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time

It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right. I hope you had the time of your life.

So take the photographs, and still frames in your mind Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial For what it's worth it was worth all the while

It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right. I hope you had the time of your life.

It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right. I hope you had the time of your life.

It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right. I hope you had the time of your life.
